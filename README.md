# spring-boot-mtu_reach
An application created with Spring-boot and Thymeleaf to allow a mentor to make notes about a mentee(student)

#Problem statement

I am part of MTU's REACH programme which aims to establish meaningful relationships between students and academic staff. 
I have been assigned students (mentees). I need a system to allow me to make notes about mentees. These notes must be date stamped so I can view the history of my interactions with the student.
Other users also need access to the service, for example, the Head of Department and REACH coordinators who wish to ensure that I am fulfilling my role. They should be given read but not write access to the system.  
You are required to create a web-based, secure application that allows me to make notes about, and keep track of, my mentees.
